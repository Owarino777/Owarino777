## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate developer on a journey to master programming fundamentals and build amazing projects! Currently diving deep into **C programming** and exploring the world of software development.

```c
typedef struct {
    char name[20];
    char role[30];
    char focus[50];
    bool learning;
} Developer;

Developer me = {
    .name = "Owarino",
    .role = "Aspiring Developer",
    .focus = "C Programming & Software Fundamentals",
    .learning = true
};
```
